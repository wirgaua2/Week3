# Hi there

Since I am now a collaborator on this repo, I have the ability to add, delete, or modify the files here. You will use this ability later this semester as work work together on a collaborative report. 

You have successfully completed this assignment **(30/30 points)**

Did you have any problems configuring git, GitHub, or the linkage between RStudio and GitHub? We will be using GitHub to version control and share all of your work for the remainder of the semester. Therefore, I want to be sure that everything is working as expected.
